Welcome to the pySkyNet documentation

.. _`pySkyNet`: https://github.com/cbonnett/SkyNet_wrapper

| SkyNet is an efficient and robust neural network training code for machine learning. It is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including autoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. SkyNet is implemented in C/C++ and fully parallelised using MPI.
| pySkyNet is a poor-mans wrapper (it makes system calls to SkyNet) that emulates the `fit` and `predict` user interface of `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_.

.. note::

   | You need to have the mpi version of SkyNet installed for pySkyNet to work!

   | Set relevant paths in SkyNet.py
